        This majestic Valley Oak (Quercus lobata) is one of the few plants Ruth Bancroft did not plant in the Garden. At 250 years old, it is a reminder that this landscape was once oak woodland until early 1900 when orchards came to dominate.

        In front of the oak, the enormous, powdery blue-gray Agave franzosinni is something Ruth did plant. Agaves were one of Ruthâ€™s favorite plants and you can see their rosette form in various shapes and sizes throughout the Garden.
